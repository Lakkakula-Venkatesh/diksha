LABORATORY

DIKSHA, IVF & ICSI Centre has advanced laboratory. The Laboratory is equipped with sophisticated state of the art technology and is manned by trained personnel.

Operation Theatre

The Operation Theatre and the Laboratory are adjacent to each other. Both these communicate with each other through a window/hatch, as well as an intervening door, which is kept closed during most of the procedures. This ensures that the eggs, which are being retrieved from the patient or the eggs that are being transferred back into the patient’s womb, are not exposed to the detrimental effect of fluctuating environments. Our theatre is equipped with the latest anesthetic machines, oximeters & cardiac monitors etc. to constantly monitor the patient.

Lab Environment

Air quality in the lab is a very important factor for growing high quality embryos in the incubator. The air quality is improved by making use of special HEPA filters and special air conditioners. All our work in the lab is done in special sterile chambers called Laminar Flows, which provides a bacteria and dust free environment in which we handle the eggs, sperms & embryos.

Microscopes & Micromanipulators

The lab have got stereo zoom microscopes from Nikon Corporation, Japan. Similarly, The lab is equipped with individually motorized Nikon Narishige Micromanipulator systems. The Nikon-Narishige system is the most widely used system, worldwide.

Incubators

The heart of the IVF Laboratory is the Carbon Dioxide Incubator in which the eggs are fertilized, the embryos are formed and the blastocysts are grown. Lab has got three such Incubators from the world leaders Heraea from Germany.

Semen & Embryo Bank
We have the facilities for embryo and semen freezing. Extra good quality embryos are cryopreserved for future use. The advanced computerized automatic freezer provides excellent and reliable temperature gradient necessary for successful freezing, long-term storage and viable recovery of gametes. The embryos and sperms are maintained in liquid nitrogen containers at -196°C. We have also started freezing testicular and ovarian tissue.

Disposables & Culture Media
We use special disposables imported from various companies worldwide:

Ovum pickup needle — CCD-France, COOK-Australia

Culture media - IVF Science Sweden or Medicult Denmark

Plastics - Falcon, UK

Injection Pipettes for ICSI - Cook, Australia

Embryo Transfer catheters- Labotect Germany or CCD France or Wallace UK

All these are imported by courier and are used within the stipulated expiry period. These are disposed after one use. This not only maintains a high pregnancy rate, but also prevents transmission of diseases like HIV (AIDS) and Hepatitis B.

INTRODUCTION
In general, a couple is considered to have a problem with infertility if they have had one year of unprotected intercourse without conception. Approximately 10 to 15% of all couples have a problem with infertility.

The number of married couples who are infertile increases significantly with the woman's age. About 10% of couples are infertile when the woman is less than 30 years old, about 15% at age 30 to 34, about 25% at age 35 to 39 and 35% at age 40 to 45. Pregnancy outcome also is affected by the women's age: for instance, the spontaneous abortion rate increases from about 10% until age 30, to 18% in the late 30's and 34% in the early 40's.

Frequently, there can be multiple causes. 1) Male factor- 40%; 2) Cervical factor 10%; 3) Implantation factor -5%; 4) Uterine and Tubal factor - 30%; 5) Ovulatory factor -<20%; 6) Peritoneal factor - 20%.
The basic infertility work-up is designed to evaluate each one of these factors in order to identify the particular problems, which may be causing infertility. The simpler, less invasive and less costly tests are usually done first.

In general, diagnostic studies and the therapeutic programs are elective procedures designed to accomplish the above-described objectives and help the couple achieve their goal of having a biological child. We do not encourage a couple to do procedures that are not feasible for them from an emotional, financial or ethical perspective. Adoption is always an option and should be considered by all couples who have an infertility problem.

**INFERTILITY WORKUP**

**Male Factor**

A. Semen Analysis:
The semen sample is used to determine whether the male is fertile. This requires a masturbation specimen collected in a sterile container obtained from the laboratory.

B. Critical Morphology:
This test is a detailed evaluation of sperm structure and is not done by most labs. In our lab it is the best predictor for sperm function. Even if a semen analysis has been done elsewhere, we may repeat the test.

C. Diagnostic Semen Wash:
This laboratory procedure accomplishes an extraction of the sperm out of the semen with re-suspension of active sperm in another solution. This diagnostic test is necessary for all IVF and GIFT procedures as well as for intra uterine insemination in selected indications. It involves a 1 or 2 day advance scheduling with the lab, collection of the specimen and drop-off in a sterile container.

D. Endocrine Studies:
When a male factor problem is not explained by the above studies, hormone evaluations are frequently done. This can include LH, FSH, testosterone, prolactin, and thyroid studies.

E. Post-Coital Test (PCT):
Evaluates the sperm present in cervical mucus after intercourse for motility, quantity and survivability.

F. Antisperm Antibody Testing:
If there is evidence of clumping of sperm on semen analysis or if no sperm are seen on PCT, then the sample may be evaluated for antisperm antibodies.

G. Testicular Biopsy:
Patients with azoospermia may wish to consider testicular biopsy with cryopreservation of any obtained sperm.

***

**Female Factor**

II. Ovulatory Factor

A. Basal Body Temperature Chart (BBT):
Daily recording of a woman's basal body temperature is the simplest method for determining whether or not she is ovulating. Ovulation is suggested if the temperature record is biphasic, i.e., a low phase and high phase, with about a 0.7°F difference.

B. Follicular Study:
Ultrasound is a diagnostic procedure which uses high frequency sound waves to picture structures inside the body. Use of the vaginal probe ultrasound allows the physician to monitor the ovulation process in the ovary during the patient's menstrual cycle. Ultrasound may also detect ovarian endometriosis and fibroids.

C. Serum Progesterone Level:
Occasionally the BBT does not give an accurate picture of whether ovulation is occurring. On occasion, a blood test to evaluate the serum progesterone level is used.

D. Endocrine Studies:
If a woman is not ovulating or has Ovulatory-dysfunction, it is very helpful to determining why this is occurring. Such endocrine studies usually include Prolactin, TSH, and DHEA-S. FSH/LH, Estradiol and thyroxin tests may be done in some circumstances.

III. Cervical Factor

A. Post-Coital Test (PCT):
The cervical mucus is evaluated after intercourse prior to ovulation to see if the mucus has the appropriate physical characteristics, and to determine if it supports viable, active sperm for a long period of time. The test is typically scheduled one to three days before expected ovulation (on 14th day of a regular 28 day cycle). The couple should have intercourse the evening prior to the appointment. The PCT is usually done as part of the follicular study cycle.

B. Antisperm Antibody Testing:
If the woman has abnormal post-coital tests, the couple may be evaluated for antisperm antibodies. Specific details for this procedure will be discussed with them if this test is indicated.

Here is the extracted text content from the image labeled `8.jpg`:

**IV. Implantation Factor**

A. Endometrial Biopsy (EBx):
The lining of the uterus is sampled to see if it is being properly prepared for implantation of the embryo. It also reflects function of the corpus luteum. The biopsy is done 11-12 days after ovulation.

**V. Uterine and Tubal Factor**

A. Hysterosalpingogram (HSG):
A radiopaque dye is injected into the uterus and x-rays are taken to view the shape and the size of the uterine cavity and fallopian tubes. The HSG also detects whether the tubes are open.

B. Diagnostic Hysteroscopy (Dx Hyst):
This diagnostic procedure uses a flexible scope, which permits the physician to look inside the uterine cavity to see whether there are any deformities or tumors distorting the cavity. It is also possible to visualize the cornua of the uterus to see if the openings into the tubes are normal. This procedure is usually done in the office.
Medication maybe taken two hours prior to the procedure for cramping that may occur with the procedure.

**VI. Peritoneal Factor**

A. Diagnostic Laparoscopy (Dx Lap):
This outpatient surgical procedure, done under general anesthesia, permits the physician to look inside the abdomen to inspect the various abdominal and pelvic organs, including the female organs. This diagnostic procedure is primarily done to evaluate whether there is evidence of endometriosis or pelvic adhesions that can interfere with ability of the egg to get from the ovary to the tube and onto the uterus. If endometrial implants and pelvic adhesions are identified, additional therapeutic procedures such as cautery or laser treatment may be done to destroy the implants and release the adhesions.

***

**Artificial Insemination (IUI)**

Artificial insemination is a technique where fertility is facilitated by inserting several sperms directly into the female genital tract. Depending upon the quality and the sperm count, insemination can be performed by two methods:

A) Artificial Insemination For Husband (AIH): The male collects the semen by masturbation and then this is artificially placed in the vagina, on the mouth of the womb (cervix), with the aid of a syringe.

B) Intrauterine Insemination (IUI): The semen is collected by masturbation, which is processed in the laboratory. The seminal plasma is discarded and the best quality sperms are harvested and kept in special culture media. The ratio of half to one ml of sperms is then artificially deposited into the uterine cavity with the aid of a thin catheter IUI.

***

**Candidates**

**Men**
- Men who are unable to ejaculate in the vagina. Causes for ejaculation failure include:
    1. Diabetes            2. Multiple sclerosis             3. Spinal cord injury            4. Retrograde ejaculation
- Men with mildly low sperm count, poor quality sperm or antisperm antibodies.
- Men who wish to freeze their sperm for possible future use before vasectomy, chemotherapy or radiotherapy for cancer.

**Women:**
1. Women with mild endometriosis
2. Women with cervical mucus hostility or poor cervical mucus

**Couples:**
1. Couples with unexplained infertility
2. Indications for IUI Using Donors Sperm

Here is the extracted text content from the image labeled `10.jpg`:

***

**Patients with azoospermia and who cannot afford advanced treatments such as ICSI. Males with genetic disorders, which can be prevented from being transmitted to the child by using donor sperms. At Diksha Test Tube Baby Centre, we treat patients with extremely low sperm counts. In such cases we advocate 3 to 6 IUI cycle attempts with simultaneous treatment for increasing counts by a male specialist.**

**Procedure of IUI**
- Ovulation stimulation and monitoring.
- The IUI can be done in a natural cycle or stimulated cycle.

**Natural Cycle:**
The growth of a single egg in the growing follicle is monitored through vaginal sonography. Once the single follicle has reached an average diameter of 1.8 to 2 cm, an HCG injection is given to bring about ovulation (release of egg from the follicle) and IUI is done after 36 to 40 hours.

**Stimulated Cycle:**
Multiple eggs formation is achieved through drugs such as Clomiphene Citrate, Gonadotropins (FSH or HMG) alone or in combination with Clomiphene or GnRH analogues. A key requirement for most ART treatments is the stimulation of multiple follicles for the production of more than one mature egg, as this is generally associated with improved chances of conception. The growth of the eggs is monitored through vaginal sonography which shows follicle size and number.

**IUI at Diksha Test Tube Baby Center:**
Normally our unit does four IUI cycles using Clomiphene. If this fails to achieve pregnancy, we use a combination of Clomiphene with Gonadotropins (FSH), and try out two cycles. If this fails to achieve pregnancy, we may go for one cycles with pure Gonadotropin drugs, with or without GnRH analogue. In case this also fails, we go for either IVF or ICSI treatment.

**Timing of IUI**
The patient is scheduled for IUI 36-40 hours after HCG injection (at the time of ovulation). The incidence of ovulation is confirmed on vaginal sonography, prior to the procedure. In international or at times two inseminations are done on consecutive days, one 24 hours and the other, 48 hours after HCG.

***

**Semen Production**
The husband is given a sterile container. He is asked to produce sample by masturbation in a semen collection room. Alternatively, he can also produce the sample at home, provided he can come to the clinic within a period of 30-45 minutes.

**Semen Preparation**
The semen is processed in the laboratory, using specially imported Culture Media. The semen can be processed and washed either by the standard swim-up method or the density gradient method using pure sperm. To maintain the potency of the sperms the Diksha Test Tube Center imported media - plastic ware and disposables.

**The Insemination**
IUI is a short procedure, lasting about 2 hours, from the time semen is produced till the time the patient is released from the hospital.

**What are the success rates of IUI?**
The success rates vary from 15-20% per cycle depending on the cause of infertility. The best results are seen among patients with cervical factor and IUI patients with severely low semen counts- less than 10 million per ml/ml.

**Can the semen be processed by Diksha Test Tube Baby Center, if the Insemination is done by the patients' neighborhood Gynecologist?**
Yes, Diksha Test Tube Baby Centre provides qualitative laboratory facilities to process semen for international and some domestic patients. Typically in such a scenario, the husband produces the sample at our location and the Gynecologist evaluates the patient. The processed sample is sent to the Gynecologist. After the completion of IUI treatment, the incubator is then returned to the lab. A facility like this one offers convenience and is also economical.

**IN VITRO FERTILIZATION (IVF)**

In order to achieve pregnancy the sperm has to unite with the egg which is released from the ovary. Normally, this union is called fertilization, occurs, with in the fallopian tube, which joins the uterus (Womb) to the ovary. However, in IVF the union occurs in the laboratory after egg and sperm have been collected and cultured together to form an embryo and then embryos are transferred to the uterus to continue growth.

**Candidates**
- If all fallopian tubes are absent or blocked due to surgery or Tubal pregnancy or infection (STD or Tuberculosis) or Endometriosis.
- Patients with unexplained infertility where all the investigations performed on the couple are normal, but who still do not conceive with routine treatments.
- Patients who have failed to become pregnant inspite of all routine treatments of infertility.
- Patients who want to become pregnant by the procedure of embryo and egg donation. In our unit, the success rates of IVF are in the region of 35 to 40%, which are comparable to the leading units in the world.

**Procedure:**
There are five major steps in the IVF and embryo transfer sequence:
1. Monitor the development of ripening egg(s) in the ovaries.
2. Collection of eggs.
3. Obtaining the sperm.
4. Putting the eggs and sperm together in the laboratory, and providing optimal conditions for fertilization and early embryo growth.
5. Transferring the embryos into the uterus.

***

To control the timing of egg ripening and to increase the chance of collecting substantial number of eggs, fertility drugs are prescribed according to each individual case. Before determining the egg retrieval schedule, we perform an ultrasound of the ovaries to check the development of eggs and a blood/urine test to measure hormone levels.

**The Egg Retrieval and embryo transfer Procedure**
The retrieval procedure to obtain the eggs is performed trans-vaginally using a hollow needle guided by the ultrasound image (this is completely comfortable under adequate sedation and general anesthesia). Eggs are gently removed from the ovaries using the needle. This is called “follicular aspiration”.

Our embryologist in our special IVF laboratory immediately identifies the eggs. They are placed with the sperm in incubators to allow fertilization to take place. The eggs are examined carefully at intervals to ensure that fertilization and cell division have taken place; the fertilized eggs are now called embryos.

Embryos are usually placed in the wife’s uterus 2 or 3 days after egg retrieval.

**INTRA CYTOPLASMIC SPERM INJECTION (ICSI)**

In the 90's males with very low counts (less than 5 million per ml) or poor quality sperms had no hope of fathering children. This problem was surmounted by the new breakthrough of ICSI, which took place in Brussels, Belgium in 1992.

Since then, many such patients have fathered a child. In ICSI all the steps are similar to the procedure of IVF, except the step of fertilization. Normally in IVF one egg is mixed with 100,000 sperms and one of the sperms fertilizes the egg on its own. In contrast, in ICSI each egg is held and injected with a single live sperm. This micro-fertilization is done with the help of a machine called the Micromanipulator. ICSI is done where the egg is held and injected with single live sperm, cultured for 2-3 days and good quality of embryos are transferred to the uterus.

**INDICATIONS:**
Indications for ICSI is a technique usually performed in males with:
1. Severely low sperm counts
2. Poor quality of sperms
3. Failed Fertilization in IVF

Males with azoospermia, where there is no sperm present in the semen. The azoospermia may be of the obstructive type where there is production of sperm in the testis but blockage of the conduction system, which brings the sperm out into the semen. Alternately, the azoospermia may be of the non-obstructive type, where there is a failure of production of sperm in the semen. Nowadays, in both these types of azoospermia, sperms can be isolated directly from the testis, using the Sperm retrieval Techniques of PESA/TESA/TESE and subsequently, ICSI can be performed.

In our unit we also believe in doing ICSI on patients who have had previous history of tuberculosis or low sperm counts, as we believe it gives better fertilization rates than standard IVF.

Nowadays, some units are advocating routine ICSI for all cases, including those with normal sperm counts. Sometimes, patients with perfectly normal sperm may have failed fertilization with IVF, we will consider doing ICSI on these husbands. If the egg is mature and there is no good fertilization after mixing, any subject failing IVF may undergo ICSI. Our success rates are in the range of 35 to 40% in both azoospermia and non-azoospermia patients, which are comparable to the best in the world.

**EGG DONATION**

**What is Egg Donation?**
Diksha Test Tube Baby Centre in egg donation, eggs are borrowed from a young woman (less than 35 yrs of age) called the donor, with her consent. These eggs are then fertilized with the sperms of the husband of the recipient woman and the resultant embryo (the earliest form of the baby), is inserted into the womb of the recipient. The success rate of this procedure is in the region of 30 to 40%. In fact, many women till the age of 50-55 have become pregnant by this technique.

**Who can qualify for Egg Donation?**
1. In this day and age more and more career-oriented women are getting married late in life. By the time they start planning to have children, they are nearing the fourth decade of their life (40 years). Fortunately, at this age, many women can conceive naturally. However nearly 20 to 25% whose men still fail to conceive within a year’s time. If they still do not become pregnant they take help of newer technologies like IVF - In Vitro Fertilization (test-tube baby) or ICSI - Intra Cytoplasmic Sperm Injection.
2. Women after the age of 40 tend to have fewer eggs in their ovaries or the quality of the eggs they produce may be poor. Thus, even new technologies like IVF and ICSI may not ensure a successful pregnancy. Furthermore, after the age of 40 to 42, many women stop producing eggs as they enter the stage of Perimenopause (decreased periods) or menopause (stopping of periods).
3. Egg donation can also be performed on women who have had multiple cycles of test-tube baby (IVF or ICSI) and have still failed to conceive.
4. For elderly or menopausal women, egg donation can be done in young women whose ovaries have failed prematurely. Sometimes such women may have undergone radiation or chemotherapy for cancer. Radiation or chemotherapy destroys the eggs and hence the ovaries become non-functional.
5. Egg donation is also used in patients who are poor responders or have major chromosomal defects so that they do not pass the genetic defect to their children.
6. Patients suffering from severe Tuberculosis and severe Endometriosis may also produce poor quality eggs and hence can be treated by egg donation.

**Embryo Donation**

**What is Embryo Donation?**
This procedure is similar to Egg Donation. However, instead of borrowing the egg and using the recipient’s husband’s sperm for fertilization, both the egg and the sperms are derived from donors.

**Who can opt for embryo donation?**
All the patients who are eligible for egg donation can also be eligible for embryo donation. In egg donation, there are the problems of getting patients to donate their eggs. Furthermore it is a relatively costly procedure, as compared to embryo donation. Embryo donation also yields the highest pregnancy rate as-high as 35-40%. Hence if the couple has no objection in using donor sperm, it is a preferred method of choice!

**What is the pregnancy rate with embryo donation?**
The pregnancy rate in our clinic is 35-40% per cycle. The reason for the high pregnancy rate is two fold. Firstly, these are often excellent quality embryos. Also, since we prepare the Endometrium using hormones, the uterine receptivity for the embryos is usually very good.

**How is Embryo Donation performed?**
This is similar to egg donation. In patients who are menstruating (having their periods) the hormonal control of the cycle is taken over by starting GnRH Analogue Injection such as Suprefact, Lupride or Nasal spray starting from the 21st day of previous cycle. Once the patient gets her period, Estradiol Valerate tablets (Progynova 2 mg) is started from the 2nd day of the period. On the 10th day an ultrasound is done to assess the receptivity of the Endometrium by measuring its thickness.

If the uterus measures of more than 9mm is good for pregnancy. Once this is achieved, one can wait to obtain good quality embryos, to place back into the womb.

In a postmenopausal woman, who have stopped having periods, cyclical hormones are given for 3-6 months till the time the endometrial cavity is ready. After that the procedure is the same, starting with Progynova tablets from the 2nd day of periods. When the endometrium is measured and is of good thickness, as the hormonal control has been naturally shut off.

***

**Blastocyst Culture**

**What is Blastocyst Culture?**
Normally, in standard IVF or ICSI cycles, the embryos are transferred back into the womb, on the second or third day after egg collection. This standardized method of day 2 or day 3 transfer yields good pregnancy rates. However this method has some disadvantages:

In the natural cycle the embryo is conceived in the fallopian tube. After this it takes 4 days for it to travel to the womb. By this time the embryo develops into mature stage called the Blastocyst, which then implants into the womb.

***

**Why is Blastocyst culture not done routinely for all patients?**
In 20 - 30% of patients, none of the embryos develop into Blastocyst. In these patients, there would be no viable embryo, available for embryo transfer.

This is a relatively new technique, and one does not know whether there would be long term adverse effects in exposing embryos for 5 days to the environment. At the same time, it would be important to note that there has been no increase in abnormalities in Blastocyst babies as compared to day 2/3 transfer babies.

**Who would qualify for Blastocyst Culture?**
- Patients have failed to get pregnant after IVF/ICSI cycles
- In patients who want to undergo Pre Implantation Genetics
- It is important to counsel the patient about the occasional risk of zero Blastocyst formation and hence zero pregnancy.

**Semen Banking**

**What is artificial insemination with Donor sample (AID) or Donor Insemination (DI)?**
In as many as 30% of infertile couples the male is responsible for infertility. A significant percentage of these males do not father children despite various treatments including ICSI. The solution is AID or DI.

**Who can benefit from AID?**
1. AID (Artificial Insemination Donor) is generally advocated for males with low semen counts (Oligoszoospermia) or zero counts (Azoospermia), where treatment with drugs, surgery and ART treatments like AIH, IUI and ICSI have proven unsuccessful. It is an acceptable alternative to adoption.
2. It is also suggested to males who may have a genetic disorder that could get transmitted to their progeny.
3. It may be used as a backup to the procedure of TESE (Testicular Sperm Extraction) and ICSI that is done for males with non-obstructive Azoospermia, especially when no sperms are found in the testicular biopsy.

**How is the Semen obtained in Semen Banking?**
A donor donates the semen after he is screened and tested as safe for various infections such as HIV, Hepatitis and other Venereal Disease. At Diksha Test Tube Baby Center, we test the donor for infections every 3 months. The semen thus obtained can be used in two ways:

1. **Fresh Semen Insemination:**
It is insemination where the donated semen is used within an hour of ejaculation. The semen can be placed on the cervix without processing or can be placed in the womb after processing as is usually done with IUI. This is done commonly in India.

2. **Frozen Semen From Semen Bank:**
After collecting the semen from an HIV negative donor, it is processed, added to straws of vials. These are then stored in liquid nitrogen containers at -196°C for six months. In short, it is quarantined. After 6 months the donor is retested for HIV. If the second HIV test is negative, this sample is released from quarantine and insemination takes place only at that time.

**Which of the two is a better alternative?**
The success rate of both fresh as well as frozen AID is almost similar. However in case of frozen AID it is important to accurately pinpoint the timing of ovulation. This is because the motility of frozen thawed sample decreases rapidly within 12 hours, in contrast to fresh insemination, where the sperms stay alive in the body for 48-72 hours. However, the biggest advantage of frozen samples is its minimal risk of HIV transmission.

**What is the Success rate of AID (Artificial Insemination Donor)?**
The success rate is in the region of 15-20%. That means if 10 couples undergo AID every month, 1 or 2 couples would become pregnant every month. At the end of 6 months 5 to 6 couples become pregnant. The remaining 4-5 couples, which do not become pregnant, can undergo further AID for 6 months. During this time 2 more will become pregnant. At the end of one year around 80% (8 out of 10 stated couples) will achieve pregnancy. The two couples that fail to become pregnant at the end of one year can either opt for IVF/ICSI with donor sperm or go in for adoption.
